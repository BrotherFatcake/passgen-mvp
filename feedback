- Added media queries for all standard devices:
    Smart phone portrait
    Smart phone landscape
    Tablet portrait
    Tablet landscape
 
 -Written CSS rules for each media query (screen size) that optimize:
    Text readability (e.g. font sizes easy to read without having to zoom in/out).
    Image to screen ratio (e.g. image width/height defined by percentage of screen size).
    Usability of UI (e.g. size and vertical spacing for clickable elements).
